### Medication Extension

<div markdown="5" class="dragon">
    <p>
    The current FHIR Resource Immunization does not have a complete set of attributes to identify the Medication of the immunization administration.
    </p>
    <p>
    From different sides this topic was announced to the HL7 WG public health to change the resource.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the meantime there is the proposal to reference the Medication via an Immunization Resource extension as defined.
